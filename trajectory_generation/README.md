### traj_planning.m :                                                    
Generates wrench cones using the function gravito_inertial_wrench.m, \
solve an optimization problem using Casadi library, with system dynamics and wrench cones as constraints, \
we consider stances on sufaces generated by get_surf.m and solve the problem as a single optimization for the whole trajectory. \

### gravito_inertial_wrench.m :
Generates the GIWC of surface(s) in input,\
uses the function functions face_span_gen.m to get the span form of each surface wrench cone,\
combines span forms to create GIWC and the convert it in face form using face_of_span.m .\
                                        
### iterative_one_stance.m :
The problem of multiple stances optimization is solved by optimizing the trajectory considering one stance at a time,\
The one stances problem is solved n_stances times varing initial, final positions and Gravito-inertial wrench cones.\
