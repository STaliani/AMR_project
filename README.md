# AMR_project
This repo contains matlab code implemented for the realization of the final project of [Autonomous and Mobile Robotics](http://www.diag.uniroma1.it/oriolo/amr/)

### wrench_cone directory: 
Contains the steps we did to understand and generate a gravito-inertial wrench cone. 

### trajectory_generation directory:
Contains scripts which generate feasible CoM trajectories constrained by gravito_inertial cones.

The content of the matlab scripts is explained in [project_documentation.pdf](https://github.com/STaliani/AMR_project/blob/main/project_documentation.pdf)
An overwiew of the project is presented in [Final_report.pdf](https://github.com/STaliani/Autonomous-Mobile-Robotics_project/blob/main/Final_report.pdf)
