contact_cone.m : contains a simple attempt of a single contact point on a surface.

multiple_points.m :                                extends the simple contact to a convex surface defined by 5 vertex, 
                                                                 computes the span and face form of the contact cones,
                                                               defines the stance given by the contact on the surface,
                    computes the correspondent Gravito-Inertial cone applied to the Center of pressure of the surface.
